# Marks-Adding  [Mini Project]

In this mini project, a csv (Comma Separated Values) file containing data [roll numbers corresponding to the marks of different students] of various students is given.

The roll numbers are repetitive in the data.

We have to write a program  to make single result for unique roll number and the corresponding marks are added up and store the final result in final_marks.csv

For adding the numbers we have to select unique roll numbers and perform sum on the marks column. We filter the data to generate a roll number only once and store it in roll_number.

Both the columns, Roll Number and Marks are appended to the data frame sum_marks_df. 

Now the data frame is added and stored in an output file

Marks Adding.csv is the input csv file

Final_marks.csv is the output csv file
